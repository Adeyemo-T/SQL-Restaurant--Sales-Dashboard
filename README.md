##  Project Background

A restaurant business requires continuous operational intelligence to analyze sales trends, identify high-performing menu items, and optimize staffing schedules based on demand. The goal is to maximize revenue and average order value while ensuring efficient daily operations.

This project delivers a clear, concise dashboard that transforms raw transaction data from a SQL database into actionable insights on customer behavior, product mix, and daily/weekly volatility.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
* **Revenue and Order Performance:** Tracking key metrics like Total Revenue, Average Order Value, and Total Orders.
* **Menu Optimization:** Identifying the **Top Selling Items** (e.g., Mac & Cheese, Lasagna) and **Top Category Contributions** to sales.
* **Staffing Efficiency:** Analyzing **Orders by Day of Week** and **Average Revenue per Order by Day of Week** to inform labor scheduling.
* **Sales Volatility:** Monitoring the **Revenue Trend Over Time** (Monthly) to anticipate peak and trough peri

* **Interactive Dashboard:** The full Restaurant Sales dashboard can be accessed [here](LINK_TO_POWER_BI_DASHBOARD).
* **Data Sourcing and Querying:** Data was sourced and aggregated directly from an **SQL Database**, showcasing proficiency in complex querying and ETL from production environments.
